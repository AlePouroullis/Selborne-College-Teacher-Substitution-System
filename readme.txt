Do not remove any files from this folder, or else the program will cease to function.
The main.exe file is what you press to open the program. To gain faster access to it,
move the 'main.exe - Shortcut' file to your desktop. 

If you encounter any problems, report them to my email: alexpouroullis123@gmail.com
