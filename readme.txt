To gain access to the necessary files for the application, press the green button with the word 'Code' on it. In the dropdown menu, select 'Download ZIP'. Delete the files you had from before, place the zipped package in the folder, unzip it and place the shortcut wherever's most convenient.

Do not remove any files from this folder, or else the program will cease to function.
The main.exe file is what you press to open the program. To gain faster access to it,
move the 'main.exe - Shortcut' file to your desktop. 

If you encounter any problems, report them to my email: alexpouroullis123@gmail.com

Hope it helps!
